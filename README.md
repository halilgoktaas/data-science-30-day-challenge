# 30 Days Data Scientist Challenge

This repository documents my 30-day journey to become job-ready for junior data science and data analyst roles.

The goal of this challenge is to build strong fundamentals in:
- SQL
- Python
- Machine Learning
- Data Analysis
- Interview preparation

Rather than focusing only on final projects, this repository emphasizes learning consistency, clear explanations, and interview-ready knowledge.
