# Customer Behavior – Purchase Prediction

## Business Problem
In e-commerce platforms, a large portion of users browse products but leave without making a purchase.
Being able to predict whether a user session will result in a purchase allows businesses to:

- Optimize marketing campaigns
- Improve retargeting strategies
- Allocate advertising budget more efficiently
- Increase overall conversion rate

## Objective
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a user session will end with a purchase, based on user behavior data collected during the session.

## Target Variable
- **Revenue**
  - 1 → Purchase occurred
  - 0 → No purchase

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains session-level information about user interactions on an e-commerce website, including:
- Page visit counts
- Time spent on different page types
- Bounce and exit rates
- Visitor type and temporal information

## Business Impact
A reliable purchase prediction model can help businesses:
- Target high-intent users with personalized offers
- Reduce marketing costs by avoiding low-intent sessions
- Improve conversion-focused decision making

## Assumptions & Limitations
- Each row represents a single user session
- User identity is anonymized
- External factors (price changes, promotions) are not included
