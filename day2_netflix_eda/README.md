# Netflix Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset to uncover trends, distributions, and key insights about the platform’s content.

## 📌 Objective

The goal of this analysis is to understand:

- The distribution of Movies vs TV Shows
- Content growth trends over time
- Popular genres, countries, and ratings
- Differences in duration between Movies and TV Shows

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Steps

- Removed completely empty and unnamed columns
- Converted `date_added` to datetime format
- Extracted year information from dates
- Parsed `duration` into:
  - `minutes` for Movies
  - `seasons` for TV Shows

## 📊 Key Insights

- Netflix significantly increased content additions after 2016
- Movies dominate the platform compared to TV Shows
- The United States is the leading content producer
- Most content targets mature audiences (TV-MA, TV-14)
