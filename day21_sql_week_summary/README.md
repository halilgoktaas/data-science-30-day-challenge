# Day 21 – Weekly Wrap-Up (Days 15–21)

## Advanced SQL Analytics & ML Decision-Making

This week focuses on **transforming advanced SQL practice and machine learning theory into production-ready analytical thinking**.
Instead of adding new queries on Day 21, the goal was to **consolidate, structure, and productize** the work completed between Days 15–20.

This mirrors real-world data roles, where analysis is followed by **interpretation, documentation, and decision support**.

## 📌 Week 15–21 Overview

### 🔹 SQL Focus (Days 15–20)

The SQL work progressed from advanced analytical foundations to full **SaaS and e-commerce analytics**, including:

* Window functions (`LAG`, `ROW_NUMBER`, `NTILE`, moving averages)
* CTE-based query structuring
* Conscious use of `LEFT JOIN` vs `INNER JOIN`
* Revenue, AOV, MRR, and usage-based metrics
* Churn labeling and risk segmentation
* Time-based analysis and customer behavior tracking
* Integration of ML outputs into SQL analytics

On **Day 21**, these queries were consolidated into a single **end-to-end SQL case study**.

### 🔹 ML Theory Focus (Days 15–20)

The ML theory track followed a deliberate progression from model behavior to production decision-making:

* **Bias–Variance Tradeoff**: Understanding model complexity and generalization
* **Cross-Validation & Data Leakage**: Reliable evaluation and leakage prevention
* **Evaluation Metrics**: Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC with business context
* **Decision Threshold & Cost-Sensitive Thinking**: Translating probabilities into decisions
* **Model Calibration**: Ensuring probability reliability
* **Model Selection Strategy**: Choosing stable and deployable models

On **Day 21**, these topics were synthesized into a **production-oriented ML decision guide**.

## 📂 Day 21 Deliverables

### 1️⃣ SQL Case Study

**`day21_sql_case_study_saas_analytics.md / .pdf`**

* End-to-end SaaS & e-commerce analytics
* Business-driven SQL questions
* Join and window function reasoning
* Revenue, churn, and risk insights
* SQL → ML → business decision linkage

---

### 2️⃣ ML Theory Wrap-Up

**`day21_ml_theory_production_decision_guide.md`**

* Unified decision-making framework

## 🎯 Why Day 21 Is a Wrap-Up Day

Day 21 intentionally focuses on **consolidation rather than new query writing**.

This reflects real-world workflows:

* Analysis → insight
* Insight → documentation
* Documentation → decision support

The outcome is **higher signal portfolio material**, not repetitive practice.
